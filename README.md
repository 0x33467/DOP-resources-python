# DOP-resources-python
Some resources to do DOP on python

## Multimethods

* It can be used to overwrite on common python types
* Can be used to meet certain conditions on the arguments (ej. x.value == 0 then run this)

## Data validation

* Can we validate inputs and outputs with pydantic? (like JSON schema with all its features)
* Can we use any data format aside JSON Schema? (what if we want to use something like grpc)

## Persistent data structures

* Is there any library that supports this?

## Atomics

* Is there any support for atomics on python?
* can we test this on any multi-threaded test?

## State management

* Is there any lib that does this state management automatically?
